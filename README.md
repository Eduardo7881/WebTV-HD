# WebTV-CSS-Remake
 A project that aims to recreate WebTV Networks' page stylization and stuff in modern CSS and HTML.
 Very (very) barebones and incomplete as of now.

## How do I use this?
 **Important:** If you're planning to use this in a project, please credit me when possible.
 Click the "Code" button at the top and click "Download ZIP". Unzip wherever you want and open the PowerOn.html page.

 Or, if you're stuck with a command line interface (specifically Linux), you can run ``git clone https://github.com/SKCro/WebTV-CSS-Remake.git``, and copy all the resources over by entering the WebTV-CSS-Remake directory, and running ``cp -r ./* <your location>``.

## TODO:
- Flesh out everything
- Make the status bar look better on non-widescreen display sizes
- Recreate more service pages like dialing, login, home page, mail, etc.
- Add functionality with JavaScript

## Why are Tizen-related files in the repo?
 I originally built this project with the Samsung Smart TV in mind, using the Tizen IDE (I wanted to see how a WebTV-like application would look), but I decided to expand it to modern browsers in general. That's why you might see some Tizen IDE leftovers (like stuff in the .gitignore and that one JS file).
 
 You can safely ignore these files, as they don't really serve much purpose.
